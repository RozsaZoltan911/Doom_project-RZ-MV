            <p class="copyright">Doom The Dark Ages covers a war called The Unholy Crusade, referenced in Doom 2016 and elaborated on more heavily in Doom Eternal, but never shown before now. That war takes place well before both of those games and saw the demons of Hell clash with the alien world of Argent D'Nur, led by King Novik and their greatest warriors, The Night Sentinels - you'll see a lot of both factions across all Doom The Dark Ages chapters.</p>

              <h4>Combat Shotgun</h4>
              <p>You start the game with the Combat Shotgun as your only gun.  By default, it can carry 20 bullets and is great in mid to close-range fights. Even in later chapters of the game, once you start upgrading it,  the Combat Shotgun remains extremely useful.</p>

              <h4>Power Gauntlet</h4>
              <p>As you advance to Chapter 1 “Village of Khalim,”  you’ll acquire the Power Gauntlet, the first melee weapon in Doom: The Dark Ages. Once you have it, you can start punching enemies, who will drop ammo  when hit for as long as you have melee stacks to spend.</p>

            <div>
              <h4>Shredder</h4>
              <p>The Shredder is a machine gun-like weapon  a fully automatic gun that shoots spikes. You get the Shredder in Chapter 1  “Village of Khalim” while you’re looking for the Demonic Portals to destroy them.</p>

              <h4>Shield Saw</h4>
              <p>Even though your shield is basically a weapon  from the first minute in Doom: The Dark Ages, it is only when you get the Shield Saw  right at the beginning of Chapter 2 “Hebeth” that you unlock its full potential.</p>

            <div>
              <h4>Accelerator</h4>
              <p>The Accelerator is the second gun you get in Chapter 2 “Hebeth.”  You find its pod while looking for the source of the demonic corruption  in the “Defend Hebeth” mission. This quite futuristic-looking weapon  stands out in the Medieval-inspired setting of Doom: The Dark Ages,  but it is a strong tool to make your way through the armies from hell.</p>

            <div class="jobb">
              <h4>Atlan’s Machine Gun</h4>
              <p>The normal attack mode of Atlan is based on using the robot’s massive  hands to punch the big bad demons attacking you. However, in Chapter 3 “Barrier Core,”  it’s when you get your hands on a double-cannon machine gun for your robot.</p>

            <div>
              <h4>Pulverizer</h4>
              <p>You get the Pulverizer, one of the coolest and grimest guns in  Doom: The Dark Ages, in Chapter 4 “Sentinel Barracks.”  Right at the beginning of the chapter, it will be waiting for you in its pod.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="jobb">
              <h4>Impaler</h4>
              <p>As you get further into Chapter 4 “Sentinel Barracks,” looking for  the Dragons Den, you receive the Impaler. This is your one-hand sniper.  Aim well and take the shot to quickly finish off your target.  It has less ammo than the other weapons, but each shot deals a lot of damage.</p>

            <div>
              <h4>Cycler</h4>
              <p>The Cycler is the second Plasma weapon you get in the game. Like the Impaler,  it shares the same slot with another gun. In this case, you change between  the Accelerator and the Cycler. You will find it during Chapter 5  “The Holy City of Aratum” in one of the ships you need to destroy in the  initial segment of the level.</p>
            </div>

              <h4>Super Shotgun</h4>
              <p>After you have faced the first Enforcer, you can get the Super Shotgun in Chapter 5  “The Holy City of Aratum.” The Super Shotgun is a short double barrel  shotgun in the best The Terminator style capable of wiping whatever is in front of it.</p>

            <div>
              <h4>Flail</h4>
              <p>A flail might be the least expected weapon in Doom: The Dark Ages. However, behind its simple concept of being a heavy ball to hit enemies, the Flail is an extremely powerful melee weapon. For you to get the Flail, you need to play the beginning of Chapter 6 “Siege - Part 1.” Its pod will be waiting for you in front of a massive gate separating you from an army of demons.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="container">
            <div class="jobb">
              <h4>Chainshot</h4>
              <p>Unlike the other weapons you have so far, the Chainshot is not in a pod or just waiting for you to be picked from a table. You need to complete a small puzzle in Chapter 6 “Siege - Part 1” as you go through the main mission of destroying the Gore Portals.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Grenade Launcher</h4>
              <p>Shooting demons is fun, but it’s only when we can explode them with a Grenade Launcher that things start to get serious. It doesn’t take long before you can get your hands on this weapon. You receive it in Chapter 8 “Abyssal Forest.”</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="jobb">
              <h4>Rocket Launcher</h4>
              <p>It only takes two chapters from the first Launcher Class gun to receive your second, the Rocket Launcher. You will get it by following the main mission in Chapter 10 “The Forsaken Plains.”</p>
            </div>
            <img src=" weapons/dark14.webp" alt="Rocket Launcher" title="Rocket Launcher">

            <div>
              <h4>Atlan’s Shotgun</h4>
              <p>If you thought that giving a double-barrel machine gun to your giant robot was too much, wait until you get your hands on Atlan’s Shotgun. You can only use this weapon in Chapter 11 “Hellbreaker.”</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="jobb">
              <h4>Ravager</h4>
              <p>One of the last guns you get in Doom: The Dark Ages is the Ravager in Chapter 12 “Sentinel Command Station.” You’re given this weapon during the main mission before you face a wave of enemies, making this the perfect opportunity to test this new weapon.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Ballistic Force Crossbow</h4>
              <p>Although the Ballistic Force Crossbow (a.k.a. BFC) is considered a weapon in Doom: The Dark Ages, you should think of it as a special attack. You get it in Chapter 14 “Spire of Nerathul.” The BFC shoots a special kind of arrow that is capable of almost instantly killing a boss.</p>

              <h4>Dreadmace</h4>
              <p>To complete your arsenal in Doom: The Dark Ages, you just need to play through Chapter 15 “City of Ry’uul” to find the Dreadmace. This alien mace is the last melee weapon you acquired in the game.</p>

              <p>Unlike the other weapons you have so far, the Chainshot is not in a pod or just waiting for you to be picked from a table. You need to complete a small puzzle in Chapter 6 “Siege - Part 1” as you go through the main mission of destroying the Gore Portals.</p>

              <h4>Grenade Launcher</h4>
              <p>Shooting demons is fun, but it’s only when we can explode them with a Grenade Launcher that things start to get serious. It doesn’t take long before you can get your hands on this weapon. You receive it in Chapter 8 “Abyssal Forest.”</p>

              <h4>Rocket Launcher</h4>
              <p>It only takes two chapters from the first Launcher Class gun to receive your second, the Rocket Launcher. You will get it by following the main mission in Chapter 10 “The Forsaken Plains.”</p>

              <p>If you thought that giving a double-barrel machine gun to your giant robot was too much, wait until you get your hands on Atlan’s Shotgun. You can only use this weapon in Chapter 11 “Hellbreaker.”</p>

              <p>One of the last guns you get in Doom: The Dark Ages is the Ravager in Chapter 12 “Sentinel Command Station.” You’re given this weapon during the main mission before you face a wave of enemies, making this the perfect opportunity to test this new weapon.</p>

              <p>Although the Ballistic Force Crossbow (a.k.a. BFC) is considered a weapon in Doom: The Dark Ages, you should think of it as a special attack. You get it in Chapter 14 “Spire of Nerathul.” The BFC shoots a special kind of arrow that is capable of almost instantly killing a boss.</p>

              <p>To complete your arsenal in Doom: The Dark Ages, you just need to play through Chapter 15 “City of Ry’uul” to find the Dreadmace. This alien mace is the last melee weapon you acquired in the game.</p>

              <p>Hell Knights are tanky brutes that constantly charge at you with Hell Charged attacks. Stay vigilant and time your parries well against them to open them up for counterattacks.</p>

              <p>Mancubi are slow but durable demons that can fire multiple slow projectiles from their arm cannons. Getting too close activates their flamethrower, which tracks you well and deals significant damage. It's best to eliminate these demons from ranged or disable them first with the Saw Shield.</p>

              <p>Corrupted by the eldritch manipulations of the witch, these demon use psychokinetic powers to fire energy barriers from long ranges. Since their projectile barriers are unparryable, its best to dodge them or block them in closer ranges.</p>

              <p>The Imp is an agile common enemy that fires projectile barriers at you. Imps usually come in packs with other lesser demons and are therefore best disposed off with the Pulverizer that can eliminate a whole area of lesser demons like the Imp.</p>

              <p>The Pinky Rider mounts on a tough Pinky mount that allows them to be mobile while they fire tracking projectiles at you. Dealing enough damage to either the Pinky or the rider allows you to eliminate the rider with a Glory Strike, disabling any projectile attacks from this enemy. However, it's easier to hit the Glory Strike threshold when hitting the rider than the mount.</p>
