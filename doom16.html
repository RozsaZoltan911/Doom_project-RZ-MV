              <h4>Chaingun</h4>
              <p>Compared to the Heavy Assault Rifle, the Chaingun has a much larger reticle and wider spread, making it inaccurate at long ranges. However it shoots at a much faster rate, of 900 RPM or 15 shots/sec, ammunition pool can be consumed quickly when firing without discipline, even more so with the use of the Mobile Turret modification.</p>

              <p>The BFG 9000 is the perfect name for a weapon that can decimate demons in a split second. The BFG 9000 is derived from the BFG 10,000, a large cannon on Phobos. The smaller version is not less powerful, however. This beast can annihilate large crowds of powerful foes in one fell swoop.</p>

              <p>While the combat shotgun is a solid weapon, the super shotgun is its more potent cousin. In fact, the weapon has been measured to dish out a whopping 1,600 damage on average, which even trounces, say, the Rocket Launcher's 900. This time, Doom has a simple, yet excellent modification to the weapon as well.</p>

              <div id="kep1" class="nagykep"><h4>hellknight</h4></div>
              <p>The Hell Knight is a towering brute built for combat deep in the bowels of Hell. These diabolical beasts are the prized gladiators of the demon-horde. They relentlessly stomp towards their target, smashing their massive fists into the ground to create shockwaves that stagger their opponent and leave them vulnerable to bone-crushing melee attacks. The Hell Knight's powerful legs allow it to leap across large distances effortlessly, quickly closing the gap to its enemy.</p>

              <p>The Mancubus is a large, somewhat slow-moving monster that can take a large amount of damage and deal just as much. It fires fireballs out of the two cannons mounted on its arms to hit targets at mid to long range and has a flamethrower ability for up close targets as well as a power wave attack which will push the player back whilst dealing great damage to any player that wanders even closer to the Mancubus.</p>

              <p>Hunters of the Sloughlands, the Cacodemon lurks the bottomless and murky depths of Hell in search of easy prey. An aimless wanderer, the Cacodemon is mostly devoid of cognitive ability, sensory awareness, and otherwise commonly occurring impulses. Driven only by a singular desire to feed, the Cacodemon is likely to appear wherever there is flesh to be consumed, bringing with it an insatiable propensity for hunger.</p>

              <div id="kep4" class="nagykep"><h4>imp</h4></div>
              <p>Imps are agile enemies that will use the environment to their advantage by climbing up and down ledges and jumping over gaps. They will often try to stay at a medium distance from the player and throw fireballs at them, but if approached they will swipe at the player with their claws then usually try to build a distance from the player again. The hell-fire balls can also be charged to deal more damage but will leave the Imps immobile for a short time.</p>

              <p>The Cyberdemon is an incredibly large demon, at least double the size of a Baron of Hell. It has pale, pinkish skin that is covered in a natural armor that covers the majority of its body. It has four small, beady eyes and a large, gaping mouth similar in appearance to a Mancubus or a Prowler. The Cyberdemon has two large, sharp horns, the left horn of which has been broken in half. The Cyberdemon's right arm has a large blade-like bone that is located on the wrist which allows the Cyberdemon to utilize its flame wall attack. The Cyberdemon's left fore-arm has been replaced with an orange UAC-engineered rocket launcher.</p>

              <div id="kep7" class="nagykep"><h4>titan</h4></div>
              <p>The Titans were originally peaceful giants who once inhabited a verdant world until they were overwhelmed and enslaved by the legions of Hell. Corrupted by Hell's malice and their mind enslaved by Hell's war priests, the Titans were transformed into powerful demons who lay waste to untold worlds.</p>
